# Vencord Desktop

A standalone Electron app that loads Discord & Vencord (very early and unfinished)

## Motivation

The official Discord Desktop app is very resource heavy compared to Discord in your Browser. There are multiple alternative Electron apps (ArmCord, WebCord, probably more) that prove how much of a performance gain you can gain by using a custom app. ArmCord already supports Vencord but makes it pretty limited for us. Making our own standalone app gives us much more control.

This is just a random idea I (V) got, and might not actually ever be finished heh
